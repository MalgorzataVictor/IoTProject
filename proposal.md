# Parking Space Monitoring System


This project aims to develop a parking space monitoring system to identify available parking spaces. Using a Raspberry Pi equipped with a camera, the system will monitor a designated parking area and utilize Azure AI for image recognition to determine the availability of parking spots. The availability will be displayed on a LCD display or mobile app. Additionally, the system will analyze parking data to predict spot availability during different hours and weather conditions of the day and on different days of the week
