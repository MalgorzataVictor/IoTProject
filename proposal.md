# Smart Proximity Alert System - SPAS 

This project aims to develop a smart distance-based alert system using an ultrasonic ranger sensor.

The system will detect objects within a predefined range and trigger a buzzer and an LCD warning when an object gets too close. Then, the data will be transmitted to an Azure IoT Hub for real-time monitoring and visualization.


**The system can be used in applications such as:**
- **Parking assistance** (alerting drivers when they are too close to an obstacle)
- **Blind spot detection** (for security or accessibility improvements)
- **Smart home automation** (detecting obstacles in pathways)
